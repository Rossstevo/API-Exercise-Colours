# API-Exercise-Colours
## Description:

I was set this task as part of my coding course.

## Challenge:

Part 1. 
Regres API has 20 endpoints (0-20) each containing unique data. Some of the endpoints contain colour data. 

Generate a random number between 0 and 20. Fetch a colour, with that number as the id: https://reqres.in/api/color/:id -> https://reqres.in/api/color/15
If the request succeeds, put a box into the HTML with a background of that color. If it fails, add a grey box to the HTML.

For Example: 
https://reqres.in/api/color/1 -> box color will be set to #98B2D1
https://reqres.in/api/color/15 -> box color will be set to grey

Part 2. 
Make a button that will run this again, adding each box to the html.

## Learning Objectives:
- Fetch () 
- External APIs

## Screenshot of my solution. 

Here are two screenshots of my solution.

## What I learned. 
In addition to learning fetch () and External API's, this exercise thought me about clarity, scope and structure. While working through the task, I found some parts of my code weren't working as I thought they would. I decided to 'unfold' my code and spell out what I was doing at each step. This not only made the bugs easier to find, it made the code easier to undertand when I revisited it.
